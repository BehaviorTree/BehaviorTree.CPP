# BehaviorTree.CPP 4.4

<p align="center"><img width=350 src="animated.svg"></p>

This  __C++ 17__ library provides a framework to create BehaviorTrees.
It was designed to be flexible, easy to use, reactive and fast.

Even if our main use-case is __robotics__, you can use this library to build
__AI for games__, or to replace Finite State Machines.

There are few features which make __BehaviorTree.CPP__ unique, when compared to other implementations:

- It makes __asynchronous Actions__, i.e. non-blocking, a first-class citizen.

- You can build __reactive__ behaviors that execute multiple Actions concurrently (orthogonality).

- Trees are defined using a Domain Specific __scripting language__ (based on XML), and can be loaded at run-time; in other words, even if written in C++, the morphology of the Trees is _not_ hard-coded.

- You can statically link your custom TreeNodes or convert them into __plugins__
and load them at run-time.

- It provides a type-safe and flexible mechanism to do __Dataflow__ between
  Nodes of the Tree.

- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user
to visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.

## Documentation and Community

You can learn about the main concepts, the API and the tutorials here: https://www.behaviortree.dev/

If the documentation doesn't answer your questions and/or you want to
connect with the other **BT.CPP** users, visit [our forum](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/discussions)

## Previous version

Version 3.8 of the software can be found in the branch
[v3.8](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/tree/v3.8).

That branch might receive bug fixes, but the new features will be implemented
only in the master branch.

# GUI Editor

Editing a BehaviorTree is as simple as editing an XML file in your favorite text editor.

If you are looking for a more fancy graphical user interface (and I know you do) check
[Groot2](https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot) out.

# How to compile

**BT.CPP** requires a compile that supports c++17.

Three build systems are supported:

- **catkin**, if you use ROS
- **colcon (ament)**, if you use ROS2
- **conan** otherwise (Linux/Windows).
- **straight cmake** if you want to be personally responsible for dependencies :)

Compiling with [conan](https://conan.io/):

Assuming that you are in the **parent** directory of `BehaviorTree.CPP`:

```
mkdir build; cd build
conan install ../BehaviorTree.CPP --output-folder=. --build=missing
cmake ../BehaviorTree.CPP -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="conan_toolchain.cmake"
cmake --build . --parallel
```

If you have dependencies such as ZeroMQ and SQlite already installed and you don't want to
use conan, simply type:

```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../BehaviorTree.CPP
cmake --build . --parallel
```

If you want to use BT.CPP in your application, please refer to the
example here: https://github.com/BehaviorTree/btcpp_sample .

# Commercial support

Are you using BT.CPP in your commercial product and do you need technical support / consulting?
You can contact the primary author, **dfaconti@aurynrobotics.com**, to discuss your use case and needs.
