/** This tutorial will teach you how basic input/output ports work.
 *
 * Ports are a mechanism to exchange information between Nodes using
 * a key/value storage called "Blackboard".
 * The type and number of ports of a Node is statically defined.
 *
 * Input Ports are like "argument" of a functions.
 * Output ports are, conceptually, like "return values".
 *
 * In this example, a Sequence of 5 Actions is executed:
 *
 *   - Actions 1 and 4 read the input "message" from a static string.
 *
 *   - Actions 3 and 5 read the input "message" from an entry in the
 *     blackboard called "the_answer".
 *
 *   - Action 2 writes something into the entry of the blackboard
 *     called "the_answer".
