== Callback `lexy::bit_cast`

    constexpr _callback_ auto bit_cast;

[.lead]
A callback that calls https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast[`std::bit_cast`].

It requires that `T` is trivially copyable.
It accepts any type that is also trivially copyable and has the same size as `T`.
It then converts the argument to `T` by reinterpreting the bits.

NOTE: If `std::bit_cast` is not available, it is emulated.
This might make the callback non-`constexpr` and require that `T` is in addition default constructible.
