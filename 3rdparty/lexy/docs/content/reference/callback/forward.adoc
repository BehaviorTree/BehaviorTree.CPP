[.lead]
`lexy::forward` is a callback that forwards an existing object.

The primary template accepts `const T&` and `T&&` and forwards them as a `T`.

The specialization for `void` is both a callback and a sink.
As a callback it accepts no arguments or a single argument of type {{% docref "lexy::nullopt" %}}, and does nothing to return `void`.
As a sink, it can be invoked multiple times with the same arguments, doing nothing and finally returning `void`.
