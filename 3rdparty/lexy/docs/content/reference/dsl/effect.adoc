[.lead]
`effect` is a {{% rule %}} that always succeeds but invokes `Fn` for its side-effect.

Parsing::
  Succeeds without consuming anything.
Errors::
  No errors.
Values::
  Invokes `Fn`, either with no arguments or the provided parse state.
  If it returns a non-void value, produces it.
  Otherwise, produces nothing.

NOTE: Since this is not a branch rule, it will never backtrack.
The side-effects of `Fn` do not need to be undone.

TIP: Use this rule to trigger semantic actions during the grammar.

NOTE: If you need access to values for the semantic action, write a production that produces them and trigger the side-effect in the value callback.
