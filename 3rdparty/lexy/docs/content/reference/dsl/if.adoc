[#if_]
== Rule `lexy::dsl::if_`

[.lead]
`if_` is a rule that tries to parse a {{% branch-rule %}}.

Parsing::
  Tries to parse `branch`.
  If that backtracks, succeeds without consuming anything.
Errors::
  All errors raised by `branch` during branch parsing.
  The rule then fails if `branch` has failed.
Values::
  All values produced by `branch`.

{{% playground-example if "Only parse a fraction if preceded by a dot " %}}

NOTE: `if_(branch)` is functionally equivalent to the {{% docref choice %}} `branch | lexy::dsl::else_`.

TIP: Use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::opt" %}} if you need a value to indicate that `branch` was not parsed.
