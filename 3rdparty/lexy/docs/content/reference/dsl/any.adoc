== Token rule `lexy::dsl::any`

{{% interface %}}

namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _token-rule_ auto any;
}

[.lead]
`any` is a {{% token-rule %}} that matches anything.

Matching::
  Consumes the entire input.
  If the rule is matched in a context where the reader has been artificially delimited,
  consumes only until the end of the partial input is reached.
Errors::
  None.
Parse tree::
  Single token node with the {{% docref "lexy::predefined_token_kind" %}} `lexy::any_token_kind`.

{{% playground-example any "Match literally any input" %}}

CAUTION: `any` does not care what input it consumes; it can be anything, including ill-formed Unicode.
To restrict the input that is consumed, use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::while_" %}} instead.
