[.lead]
`operator+` (sequence) is a rule that parses multiple rules one after the other.

Parsing::
  Parses `lhs`, then parses `rhs`.
Errors::
  All errors raised by `lhs` and/or `rhs`.
  The rule fails if either of them has failed.
Values::
  All values produced from `rhs` followed by all values produced by `rhs`.
