concept _char-class-rule_ = _token-rule_<T> && â€¦;
----

A _char class rule_ is a special {{% token-rule %}} that matches a single code point from a given set, the _char class_.
Each char class rule has the same parsing behavior:

Matching::
  * If the current code unit is an ASCII character, matches and consumes it.
    Checks if that character is part of the char class.
  * Otherwise, if the char class contains non-ASCII characters, matches and consumes all code points that form a code point in this encoding.
    For ASCII, UTF-32, {{% docref "lexy::default_encoding" %}} and {{% docref "lexy::byte_encoding" %}}, this is always a single code unit, for UTF-8, this is up to 4 code units, and for UTF-16, this is up to 2 code units.
    Checks if that code point is part of the char class.
Errors::
  {{% docref "lexy::expected_char_class" %}} with the name of the char class, at the starting reader position if
  * the current code unit is ASCII but not part of the char class, or
  * the current code point is not part of the char class, or
  * the current code unit(s) do not form a valid code point.
    This includes surrogates, overlong UTF-8 sequences, or out of range code points.
  The rule then fails.

For a char class rule, {{% docref ".error" %}} and {{% docref ".kind" %}} are overridden to ensure the resulting token rule is still a char class rule.
In the case of `.error`, the corresponding error type is raised instead.

{{% interface %}}

template <typename T>
concept _literal-char-class-rule_;
----

A _literal char class rule_ is a rule that can behave like a char class.
Those are

* a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit" %}} (or {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit_c" %}}) rule matching a single ASCII character,
* a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit" %}} (or {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit_c" %}}) rule whose char type is `char32_t` matching a single character,
* a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit_b" %}} rule matching an arbitrary byte,
* a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit_cp" %}} rule, and
* {{% docref "lexy::dsl::operator/ (char class)" %}} combinations of the above.

Literal char class rules can be used with the char class operators.
If they specify a non-ASCII character, the input {{% encoding %}} must be ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 (if it is ASCII, the character will never be matched).
The exception is {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit_b" %}} where the encoding must be {{% docref "lexy::default_encoding" %}} or {{% docref "lexy::byte_encoding" %}}.

`LEXY_CHAR_CLASS` is a {{% char-class-rule %}} that is a (re)named version of `CharClassRule`.

It is equivalent to `CharClassRule`, but overrides its name (in the error) to be the string literal `Name`.
It also type-erases the type of `CharClassRule` to shorten it, which can improve error messages and compilation times.
