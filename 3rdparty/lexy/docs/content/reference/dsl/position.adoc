[#position]
== Rule `lexy::dsl::position`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _rule_ auto position;
}

[.lead]
`position` is a rule that produces the current input position without consuming anything.

Parsing::
  Always succeeds without consuming anything.
Errors::
  None.
Values::
  An iterator to the current position of the reader.
Parse tree::
  A single token node, whose range is begins and ends at its position, with the {{% docref "lexy::predefined_token_kind" %}} `lexy::position_token_node`.

{{% playground-example position "Determine the position of a function declaration" %}}

NOTE: As a rule, `position` does not do {{% docref whitespace %}} skipping.
If used immediately before a {{% token-rule %}} it will produce the position that is the beginning of this token,
because whitespace skipping is done _after_ token rules.
