/**
 * @brief The ParallelNode execute all its children
 * __concurrently__, but not in separate threads!
 *
 * Even if this may look similar to ReactiveSequence,
 * this Control Node is the __only__ one that can have
 * multiple children RUNNING at the same time.
 *
 * The Node is completed either when the THRESHOLD_SUCCESS
 * or THRESHOLD_FAILURE number is reached (both configured using ports).
 *
 * If any of the thresholds is reached, and other children are still running,
 * they will be halted.
 *
 * Note that threshold indexes work as in Python:
 * https://www.i2tutorials.com/what-are-negative-indexes-and-why-are-they-used/
 *
 * Therefore -1 is equivalent to the number of children.
