 * @brief The SequenceNode is used to tick children in an ordered sequence.
 * If any child returns RUNNING, previous children will be ticked again.
 *
 * - If all the children return SUCCESS, this node returns SUCCESS.
 *
 * - If a child returns RUNNING, this node returns RUNNING.
 *   The loop is restarted, but already completed children are not halted.
 *   This generally implies that ConditionNode are ticked again.
 *
 * - If a child returns FAILURE, stop the loop and return FAILURE.
