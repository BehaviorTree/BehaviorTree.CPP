 * @brief The FallbackNode is used to try different strategies,
 * until one succeeds.
 * If any child returns RUNNING, previous children will be ticked again.
 *
 * - If all the children return FAILURE, this node returns FAILURE.
 *
 * - If a child returns RUNNING, this node returns RUNNING.
 *   The loop is restarted, but already completed children are not halted.
 *   This generally implies that ConditionNode are ticked again, but ActionNodes aren't.
 *
 * - If a child returns SUCCESS, stop the loop and return SUCCESS.
