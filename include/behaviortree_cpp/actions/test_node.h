/**
 * @brief The TestNode is a Node that can be configure to:
 *
 * 1. Return a specific status (SUCCESS / FAILURE)
 * 2. Execute a post condition script (unless halted)
 * 3. Either complete immediately (synchronous action), or after a
 *    given period of time (asynchronous action)
 *
 * This behavior is changed by the parameters pased with TestNodeConfig.
 *
 * This particular node is created by the factory when TestNodeConfig is
 * added as a substitution rule:
 *
 *    TestNodeConfig test_config;
 *    // change fields of test_config
 *    factory.addSubstitutionRule(pattern, test_config);
 *
 * See tutorial 11 for more details.
